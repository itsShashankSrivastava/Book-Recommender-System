## Book Recommendation System

This project is a book recommendation system implemented using two different approaches: popularity-based recommendation and collaborative filtering. The system aims to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their preferences and similarities with other users.

**Popularity-Based Recommendation System**

The popularity-based recommendation system suggests books to users based on their overall popularity among all users. This approach is useful for introducing users to popular and widely-read books, regardless of their specific preferences.

**Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System**

The collaborative filtering recommendation system utilizes cosine similarity scores between books to recommend items to users. By analyzing user-item interactions and similarities between users, this approach offers personalized recommendations tailored to individual tastes.

**User Interface**

The user interface (UI) of this project is developed using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. Flask provides a simple and efficient way to build web applications, allowing users to interact with the recommendation system through a user-friendly interface.
